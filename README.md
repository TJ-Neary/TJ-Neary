### Showcase

**[HQ-Command-Center](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/HQ-Command-Center)** — AI-augmented project command center coordinating 11 software projects across two AI agents (Anthropic Claude + Google Gemini). Multi-agent orchestration, automated standards distribution, cross-project communication, drift detection, strategic advisory board, and security pipeline. Python 3.12+ / Jinja2 / YAML / Ollama.

### Open Source

**[CoreRag](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/CoreRag)** — Local-first knowledge engine with semantic search, GraphRAG, and Claude Desktop integration via MCP. Hybrid search (vector + BM25), cross-encoder reranking, multi-format document ingestion, and three-layer PII detection. 392 tests. Python 3.12+ / LanceDB / FastAPI / Sentence Transformers.

**[AI_Eval](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/AI_Eval)** — LLM evaluation framework with hardware-aware benchmarking on Apple Silicon (M4 Max). Actionable model selection based on real-world performance across code generation, document analysis, and structured output. Supports local inference (Ollama) and cloud APIs. 525 tests. Python 3.12+ / MLX / Ollama.

**[TommyTalker](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/TommyTalker)** — Privacy-first macOS voice intelligence suite. Push-to-talk with app-aware text formatting, session recording, and word replacement — no cloud dependencies. Optimized for Apple Silicon MPS acceleration. 95 tests. Python 3.12+ / Whisper / Metal.
