## TJ Neary

Building at the intersection of people, strategy, adoption, and technology. I transform strategic intentions and ambiguity into working systems—specializing in local-first AI, RAG pipelines, and privacy-preserving tooling.

### Current Work

**[AI_Eval](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/AI_Eval)** — LLM evaluation framework with hardware-aware benchmarking. Provides actionable model selection guidance based on real-world performance rather than leaderboard rankings. Supports local inference (Ollama) and cloud APIs with comprehensive scoring across code generation, document analysis, and structured output.

**[CoreRag](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/CoreRag)** — Local-first knowledge engine with semantic search, GraphRAG, and Claude Desktop integration via MCP. Features hybrid search (vector + BM25), cross-encoder reranking, multi-format document ingestion, and privacy-preserving PII detection.

**[TommyTalker](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/TommyTalker)** — Privacy-first macOS voice assistant optimized for Apple Silicon. Provides conversational AI capabilities without cloud dependencies.

### Technical Focus

**Core Technologies:** Python 3.12+ • Ollama • LanceDB • FastAPI • MLX • Sentence Transformers

**Specializations:** Local-first AI architecture • RAG system design • Apple Silicon optimization • MCP server development • Vector databases • Semantic search

**Engineering Practices:** Test-driven development • Type safety (mypy) • Comprehensive documentation • Security-first design • Hardware-aware optimization

### Background

After 25 years of military service focusing on organizational transformation, learning & development, and workforce strategy, I now build systems that bridge people strategy and technical implementation. My work combines systematic operational thinking with hands-on development—an approach that applies military planning discipline to AI system architecture.

**Education & Credentials:** MBA • PMP • PMI-ACP • SHRM-SCP • SAFe 6 Scrum Master

### Approach

I build systems that solve categories rather than instances. Every project follows the same discipline: structured planning, comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and execution-focused delivery. Whether designing organizational change frameworks or RAG pipelines, the methodology remains consistent—translate ambiguity into actionable architecture, then implement with rigor.
