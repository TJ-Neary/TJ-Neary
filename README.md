Python 3.12+ / PyQt6 / mlx-whisper / Anthropic SDK.

**[VA-Assistant](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/VA-Assistant)** — AI-powered VA claims analysis that discovers claimable conditions from medical records, identifies rating errors in VA decisions, and generates evidence-backed appeal packages. 9-phase condition discovery pipeline, dual-persona adversarial analysis, hybrid RAG search, 1,324 tests. Python 3.12+ / FastAPI / Qdrant / React / Anthropic Claude.

### Open Source

**[CoreRag](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/CoreRag)** — Local-first knowledge engine with semantic search, GraphRAG, and Claude Desktop integration via MCP.

**[AI_Eval](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/AI_Eval)** — LLM evaluation framework with hardware-aware benchmarking on Apple Silicon (M4 Max). Actionable model selection based on real-world performance across code generation, document analysis, and structured output. Supports local inference (Ollama) and cloud APIs. 203 tests. Python 3.12+ / MLX / Ollama.

**[TommyTalker](https://github.com/TJ-Neary/TommyTalker)** — Privacy-first macOS voice intelligence suite. Push-to-talk with app-aware text formatting, session recording, and word replacement — no cloud dependencies. Optimized for Apple Silicon MPS acceleration. 95 tests. Python 3.12+ / Whisper / Metal.
